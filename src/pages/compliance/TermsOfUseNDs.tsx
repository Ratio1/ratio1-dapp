                                        Node Deeds are strictly utility-based and are designed to facilitate participation in

                                        Node Deeds are not security tokens under applicable laws. Node Deeds do not represent
                                        ownership, equity, profit-sharing, dividends, or any investment expectation in the
                                        Company or the Ecosystem. Purchasers acknowledge that Node Deeds are not linked with any
                                        expectation of profit or financial return and that any Tokens mined are solely based on
                                        the Purchaser's active participation in operating a node.

                                        In Our view, the Node Deeds do not meet the criteria of an "investment contract" under
                                        the Howey Test, as established by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.
                                        (1946). The Howey Test defines a security as involving (1) an investment of money, (2)
                                        in a common enterprise, (3) with an expectation of profits, (4) solely from the efforts

                                        <strong>5.13.</strong> Node Deeds are not registered with the U.S. Securities and
                                        Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities, as they are utility-based licenses. Purchasers
                                        acknowledge that Node Deeds do not meet the criteria of a security under the Howey Test
                                        or other applicable frameworks. In this respect, Node Deeds operate in a decentralized
                                        network where rewards are tied to individual node performance, not a centralized profit
                                        pool managed by the Company. Node Deeds are sold as utility licenses for operating nodes
                                        and mining Tokens through active participation. The Company does not promote Node Deeds
                                        as investment vehicles, and any rewards depend on the Purchaser's computational efforts,
                                        not passive gains. Rewards from Node Deeds require active node operation by the
                                        Purchaser, not the Company or third parties. This distinguishes Node Deeds from
                                        securities, as profits are not derived solely from others' efforts.
