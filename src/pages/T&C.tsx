                    <strong>4. The Ecosystem</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Ecosystem includes: i) the Naeural Protocol- a platform specifically designed to facilitate the rapid
                    development and deployment of AI applications, as well as the Tools from the platform.; ii) the Node Deeds-
                    the licenses that grant the rights to&nbsp;run&nbsp;processing nodes ; iii) the Tokens; iv) the Website and
                    iv) the dApp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(i)</strong> The platform integrates blockchain technology, enhancing the capabilities in terms of
                    security, transparency, and decentralized data management. In this respect, Our mission is to democratize
                    artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;by establishing a comprehensive network that facilitates the easy
                    development and deployment of AI applications—from their initial concept to full execution.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Within the Ecosystem there is established a utility blockchain network wherein AI processing nodes
                    (the&nbsp;<strong>"Node Providers"</strong>)&nbsp;that have Node Deeds will collaborate to execute tasks
                    aligned with real-life use cases and it is generated revenue for the Node Providers who contribute services
                    to the network.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(ii)</strong> There are three types of Node Deeds: Genesis Node Deed (GND), Master Node Deed (MND)
                    and Node Deed (ND). The Node Deeds grant the right to generate the Tokens through mining, based on the
                    activity of the Node Provider in the Ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    The Node Deed represents the license available for public purchase which enables the operation of individual
                    edge nodes within the Naeural Protocol, respectively the Ecosystem and granting to its holder the right to
                    use the Naeural Protocol, the right and ability to contribute with compute power within the Naeural Protocol
                    and receive rewards, and the right to mine Tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Node Deed grant the right to generate the Tokens through mining, based on the activity of its holder in
                    the Ecosystem. The Tokens are distributed and mined through the Naeural Edge Nodes paired with the Node
                    Deeds licenses and can be claimed through the dApp.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>(iii)</strong> The Tokens are the Naeural Protocol utility tokens that are mined by the holders of
                    the licenses defined above as Node Deeds, and distributed through the Node Deeds and the Naeural Edge Node
                    via the management features of the dApp. The&nbsp;Node&nbsp;Deed must be installed by each participant in
                    the Ecosystem on their computer or computers, on-premises or on cloud infrastructures. Based on the license
                    type (Node Deed) held by each participant in the Ecosystem, each participant is entitled to use the Naeural
                    Protocol and can mine Tokens through providing AI compute power.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    For the avoidance of any doubt, there is no Token Generation Event (TGE), each participant in the Ecosystem
                    generates the Tokens through mining. The Company is not performing any actions in relation to the issuance
                    of the Tokens and the Company does not exercise any control on the Tokens’ generation. The Tokens aim to
                    fulfill several purposes and functionalities within the Ecosystem, as stated in the White Paper.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    The Tokens are mined by the participants in the Ecosystem/ holders of the Node Deeds, they are not minted or
                    otherwise issued by the Company.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Company has no intention of acting as a broker, dealer, or crypto exchange, directly or indirectly, in
                    relation to any transaction involving&nbsp;Tokens.
                </p>
